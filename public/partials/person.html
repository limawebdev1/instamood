        <div class="panel-body">
            <h4> Openness </h4>
            <p> Openness to experience: (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious). Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference
                for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent, and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived
                as unpredictability or lack of focus. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences, such as skydiving, living abroad, gambling, et cetera. Conversely,
                those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance, and are characterized as pragmatic and data-drivenâ€”sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded.</p>
            <h4> Conscientiousness </h4>
            <p> Conscientiousness: (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless). A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness
                is often perceived as stubborn and obsessive. Low conscientiousness are flexible and spontaneous, but can be perceived as sloppy and unreliable.</p>
            <h4> Extraversion </h4>
            <p> Extraversion: (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved). Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived
                as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. </p>
            <h4> Agreeableness </h4>
            <p> Agreeableness: (friendly/compassionate vs. analytical/detached). A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether
                a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.
            </p>
            <h4> Emotional Range </h4>
            <p> Emotional Range, a.k.a Neuroticism: (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident). The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional
                stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". Low emotional range manifests as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. High emotional range causes
                a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure.
